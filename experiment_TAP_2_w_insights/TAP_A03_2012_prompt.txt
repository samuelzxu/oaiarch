Analysis for TAP_A03_2012

Analyze these four images to identify and describe in detail the major terrain and geomorphological features. 
Search carefully for any archaeologically interesting anomalies. The images show:

The images are from the region of V28W+FW São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil, at (-3.1338643705, -54.952720345).

If anomalies are found:
  1. Draw on your knowledge of the region (V28W+FW São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil) and its history.
  2. Explain how the anomaly fits into the broader historical context.
  3. Discuss how it might challenge or advance current theories in the field. Give detailed background information on the geographic, historical, and archaeological context of the region.
  4. Note any differences or correlations between the different data sources.
  5. Provide actionable insights. These insights will be used as leverage for future discovery of sites, that is, it will be appended to future prompts to AI models.

Target your analysis to technology and archaeology enthusiasts interested in realistic, evidence-based advancements. Provide as much detail as possible.

Always include your actionable insights inside triple brackets:

[[[
actionable insights that can be used to discover new sites, such as:
- "Note the presence of a large, flat area at the coordinates (lat, lon) that could indicate an ancient settlement."
- "The presence of a linear feature in the LiDAR data suggests a possible ancient road or pathway."
- "The NIR band shows unusual vegetation patterns that may indicate buried structures or features."

If you detect an anomaly, output:
```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},
"anomaly_2": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },

    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},
```

The images show:
1. A digital terrain model extracted from LiDAR data using cloth simulation
2. A true-color (visual) Sentinel-2 satellite image
3. A near-infrared (NIR) Sentinel-2 band image


Previous insights:
- At anomaly_1 (–3.0498, –54.9474), run a GPR transect across the embankment and drill a series of shallow auger probes to confirm terra preta layering, charcoal content, and core composition.
- Over anomaly_2 (–3.0506, –54.9467), task a UAV equipped with multispectral + LiDAR for sub-10 cm resolution mapping; follow up with shallow geotechnical coring to detect buried walls or floors.
- In anomaly_3 (–3.0499, –54.9478), install a grid of moisture sensors and extract a sediment core to reconstruct fill history, test for pond function and faunal remains.
- Expand high-resolution UAV-LiDAR coverage over a 1 km² block around these anomalies to trace any connecting causeways, raised platforms or subsidiary house mounds.
- Compare current DTM/optical results with any available 1970s aerial photographs to prioritize sectors with minimal recent disturbance for test excavation.
