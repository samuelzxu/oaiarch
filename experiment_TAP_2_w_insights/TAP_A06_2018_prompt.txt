Analysis for TAP_A06_2018

Analyze these four images to identify and describe in detail the major terrain and geomorphological features. 
Search carefully for any archaeologically interesting anomalies. The images show:

The images are from the region of W3X3+V3 Terra Preta, Belterra - PA, Brazil, at (-3.0502890995, -54.94729255).

If anomalies are found:
  1. Draw on your knowledge of the region (W3X3+V3 Terra Preta, Belterra - PA, Brazil) and its history.
  2. Explain how the anomaly fits into the broader historical context.
  3. Discuss how it might challenge or advance current theories in the field. Give detailed background information on the geographic, historical, and archaeological context of the region.
  4. Note any differences or correlations between the different data sources.
  5. Provide actionable insights. These insights will be used as leverage for future discovery of sites, that is, it will be appended to future prompts to AI models.

Target your analysis to technology and archaeology enthusiasts interested in realistic, evidence-based advancements. Provide as much detail as possible.

Always include your actionable insights inside triple brackets:

[[[
actionable insights that can be used to discover new sites, such as:
- "Note the presence of a large, flat area at the coordinates (lat, lon) that could indicate an ancient settlement."
- "The presence of a linear feature in the LiDAR data suggests a possible ancient road or pathway."
- "The NIR band shows unusual vegetation patterns that may indicate buried structures or features."
]]]

If you detect an anomaly, output:
```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},
"anomaly_2": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon,

        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},
```

The images show:
1. A high-resolution elevation raster from OpenTopography
2. A digital terrain model extracted from LiDAR data using cloth simulation
3. A true-color (visual) Sentinel-2 satellite image
4. A near-infrared (NIR) Sentinel-2 band image


Previous insights:
- Prioritize pedestrian and auger transects along the exposed crest of the NWâ€“SE ridge (Anomaly 1) to sample for terra preta, compaction lenses, and roadside postholes.
- Schedule micro-UAV LiDAR over the circular ring mound (Anomaly 2) with <0.2 m resolution to resolve sub-mound chambers or entrance causeways.
- Conduct ground-penetrating radar transects across the rectangular platform (Anomaly 3) to test for buried wall foundations or floor surfaces.
- Overlay local land-use and cadastral maps to locate other misaligned plateau segments that may indicate buried causeway branches.
- Target soil coring in and around the ring mound for charcoal, phosphate, and ceramic sherd concentration, to date sequential construction phases.
- Extend NIR anomaly mapping along parallel ridges to map out a larger grid of roads or drainage channels.
