Analysis for TAP_A02_2016

Analyze these four images to identify and describe in detail the major terrain and geomorphological features. 
Search carefully for any archaeologically interesting anomalies. The images show:

The images are from the region of V2J8+J7 São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil, at (-3.118387501, -54.984333945).

If anomalies are found:
  1. Draw on your knowledge of the region (V2J8+J7 São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil) and its history.
  2. Explain how the anomaly fits into the broader historical context.
  3. Discuss how it might challenge or advance current theories in the field. Give detailed background information on the geographic, historical, and archaeological context of the region.
  4. Note any differences or correlations between the different data sources.
  5. Provide actionable insights. These insights will be used as leverage for future discovery of sites, that is, it will be appended to future prompts to AI models.

Target your analysis to technology and archaeology enthusiasts interested in realistic, evidence-based advancements. Provide as much detail as possible.

Always include your actionable insights inside triple brackets:

[[[
actionable insights that can be used to discover new sites, such as:
- "Note the presence of a large, flat area at the coordinates (lat, lon) that could indicate an ancient settlement."
- "The presence of a linear feature in the LiDAR data suggests a possible ancient road or pathway."
- "The NIR band shows unusual vegetation patterns that may indicate buried structures or features."

If you detect an anomaly, output:
```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},
"anomaly_2": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat,

The images show:
1. A high-resolution elevation raster from OpenTopography
2. A digital terrain model extracted from LiDAR data using cloth simulation
3. A true-color (visual) Sentinel-2 satellite image
4. A near-infrared (NIR) Sentinel-2 band image


Previous insights:
- Note the presence of a large flat area near (‐3.1187, ‐54.9849) marked by regular circular mounds; undertake auger probes for anthropogenic soils and ceramics.  
- The NW–SE linear ridges at (‐3.1183, ‐54.9843) suggest hidden raised fields; deploy micro‐UAV LiDAR or ground-penetrating radar along transects perpendicular to ridge orientation.  
- The NIR‐dark depression at (‐3.1190, ‐54.9838) is a moisture‐rich anomaly—plan shovel test pits on the east flank where spectral contrast peaks.  
- Extend mapping of parallel ridges 500 m upslope and downslope to locate connected causeways or water‐control channels.  
- Compare these microtopographic patterns to historical aerial imagery (1965–80) to isolate undisturbed forest margins for preservation and excavation.
