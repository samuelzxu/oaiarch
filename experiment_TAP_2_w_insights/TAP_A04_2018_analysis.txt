The four datasets cover the same ~200 × 200 m patch of Amazonian floodplain just south of the Belterra road (X2MP+3W São Benedito, –3.01736, –54.96268). Below is a brief description of each layer, followed by an overall geomorphological interpretation, and then a discussion of potential archaeological targets. No unambiguous cultural features (pyramids, plazas, causeways) stand out in these particular images, but there are subtle micro‐reliefs and spectral anomalies that merit targeted follow‐up.

1. Elevation raster (OpenTopography)  
• Overall relief is very low (±2 m across the scene).  
• The central-west quadrant shows a very gentle convexity (slightly higher) sloping toward the SE.  
• Subtle linear undulations (~0.2–0.5 m high) run roughly NW–SE, parallel to the modern road axis. These may represent remnant natural ridges or anthropogenic levees.

2. LiDAR‐derived cloth‐simulation DTM  
• Stray data gaps produce black “holes,” but the ground model confirms the gentle ridges seen in 1.  
• A faint trace of two orthogonal linear features: one trending NW–SE and another less distinct trending NE–SW.  
• No high‐amplitude mounds or enclosures appear.

3. True‐color Sentinel-2 (RGB)  
• The scene is a patchwork of primary forest (deep green) and secondary regrowth/pasture (lighter green–yellow).  
• Several small clearings in the SE quadrant (possibly recent pasture) coincide with slightly brighter soil patches.

4. NIR Sentinel-2  
• Dry‐season NIR reflectance is fairly uniform.  
• A few small, brighter spots (higher NIR) in the SE could mark denser grassy regrowth or shallow soil disturbances.  
• No broad concentric rings or rectilinear spectral anomalies visible.

Geomorphological setting  
– Located on a low, seasonally flooded floodplain of the Tapajós headwaters.  
– Natural levees crest along old river channels; backswamps in the lowest parts.  
– Human occupation in this region (pre‐European) is known from pottery scatters, “terra preta” dark earth, causeways, small mounded villages—but usually at larger elevations or along major ridges.

Archaeological context & potential  
– Belterra Road sites (late Holocene, Arauquinoid and Suya phases) often exploit natural levees for settlement.  
– Medium‐density populations created networks of causeways (<1 m high) linking small mounds. These can be nearly invisible in raw imagery.  
– “Terra preta” signatures sometimes appear as subtle NIR anomalies where charcoal‐rich soils enhance vegetation vigor.

No obvious cultural mound or plaza shows up here, but the gentle NW–SE ridge and isolated NIR hotspots may warrant ground inspection.  

actionable insights  
[[[  
- Focus a pedestrian and soil‐probe survey along the faint NW–SE ridge at approx. (-3.0182, ‑54.9629). Even a low (0.3–0.5 m) levee crest here could bury compacted living floors or pathway fill.  
- Conduct a UAV‐LiDAR micro‐flight strip across the area to fill the DTM voids and sharpen relief; look for small (<0.2 m) “berms” perpendicular to the primary ridge axis.  
- Investigate the few higher‐NIR pixels in the SE quadrant near (-3.0168, ‑54.9626) with ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) to detect shallow pits or charcoal‐rich soil lenses (terra preta).  
- Cross‐compare local land‐parcel boundary azimuths (from cadastral maps) with the DTM’s subtle ridges to isolate misaligned segments—an indicator of buried causeways or property lines co‐opting pre‐existing paths.

Since no unambiguous structural anomaly appears, these steps will refine the residual microtopography and spectral patterns and help pinpoint any small anthropogenic features for test coring or surface collection.
