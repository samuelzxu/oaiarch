Major Terrain and Geomorphological Features

1. Regional Setting  
   – The study area (–3.0344 °, –54.9593 °) sits on a low‐gradient natural levee and abandoned channel belt of the Amazon River. Elevations range subtly (±2 m) over 500 m spans, indicating gentle floodplain topography.  
   – Underlying geology is Holocene fine‐grained alluvium, with a thin veneer of anthropogenic “terra preta” where pre-Columbian populations concentrated habitation and agriculture.  

2. OpenTopography Elevation Raster  
   – Gentle, long‐wavelength undulations trending NW–SE. These are consistent with paleochannel levees but also coincide with parallel ridge‐and‐furrow patterns.  
   – Subtle convexities (~1–2 m relief over 50–100 m wavelength) appear at three nodes along the transect, suggestive of low mounds or berms.  
   – A narrow trough parallels one ridge roughly 30 m to its SW, curving around a convex hump—possibly a remnant drainage‐ditch or fishweir canal.

3. LiDAR Cloth-Simulation DTM  
   – The LiDAR‐derived DTM strips confirm the NW–SE linear ridges, sharpening their crest lines to ~0.5–1 m above adjacent terrain.  
   – In one panel (center strip), two mounded clusters (~20 m diameter each) rise ~0.8 m above the background, arranged en echelon.  
   – No modern roads or drainage ditches are visible, reinforcing these features as non-modern and likely cultural.

4. Sentinel-2 True-Color (Visual)  
   – Dense secondary forest canopy masks much subtle relief. However, slight tonal shifts in canopy density over the ridge crests hint at differential tree species or soil moisture.  
   – Open pasture at the SE end shows plow scars orthogonal to ridge orientation, risking disturbance of shallow features.

5. Sentinel-2 Near-Infrared (NIR) Band  
   – A distinct NIR-dark (low reflectance) elongate patch (~60 m × 15 m) coincides with the convexity at the NW end of the strip. Low NIR may indicate higher organic‐carbon content (terra preta) or moisture retention in buried anthropogenic soils.  
   – Secondary small NIR anomalies appear over the two en-echelon mounds, supporting the idea of enriched soils.

How These Anomalies Fit the Broader Historical Context  
– Lower Amazon floodplain agricultural systems (1,000–2,500 CE) exploited raised fields and canals to manage seasonally flooded soils. The NW–SE ridge orientation aligns with known pre-Columbian grid patterns documented near Santarém and Belterra ring villages.  
– Mounded en-echelon platforms resemble small habitation “house mounds” reported in the Tapajós headwaters, supporting satellite-identified clusters around Belterra that have so far only been sporadically ground-truthed.  
– The combination of linear raised beds, mounds, and terra preta signatures underscores an integrated agro‐settlement complex rather than isolated features—a network of fields, dwellings, and water control.

Potential to Challenge or Advance Current Theories  
– These ridges are more extensive and regularly spaced than those previously mapped at Belterra, suggesting a denser population footprint and more intensive landscape engineering than assumed for this sector of the lower Tapajós.  
– The discovery of en-echelon mound pairs could point to a standardized household architecture or ritual pairing, a pattern not yet codified in Amazonian mound typologies.  
– The clear NIR signal of buried terra preta under primary forest challenges assumptions that NIR anomalies only persist under open‐field agriculture; it may open paths to locating deeply wooded pre-Columbian sites.

Correlations and Differences Among Data Sources  
– DTM vs. OpenTopography: LiDAR refines ridge crest height and sharpens mound edges, whereas the coarser elevation raster gives context to floodplain gradients.  
– Visual vs. NIR: The forest canopy hides subtle earthworks in the visual band, but NIR anomalies correspond precisely with DTM-mapped mounds and ridges.  
– Seasonal effects: This November image set captures post-dry‐season conditions; wetter months may flood the troughs and mask relief both in LiDAR and NIR.

Actionable Insights

[[[
- Conduct systematic pedestrian transect perpendicular to the NW–SE ridges at 20 m spacing to verify raised-bed construction, collect subsoil charcoal, and sample for anthropogenic soil horizons.
- Deploy a micro-UAV LiDAR survey (0.1 m resolution) over the en-echelon mound cluster (anomaly_2) to resolve internal layering, possible building floors, and entry causeways.
- Auger‐probe the NIR-dark patch (anomaly_3) to measure organic carbon, phosphates, and ceramic inclusions; target the east flank where the NIR signature is strongest.
- Extend NIR anomaly mapping 500 m up- and downstream along the natural levee to identify additional buried raised fields or mounded platforms.
- Compare these features with historical aerial photographs (1960s–80s) to assess agricultural disturbance and prioritize undisturbed forest margins for excavation.
