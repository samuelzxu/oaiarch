I have examined all four layers—the high-resolution elevation raster, the LiDAR-derived DTM, the Sentinel-2 true-color scene, and the NIR band—for geomorphology and subtle soil/vegetation signatures that might betray buried archaeological features. Below is a summary of the major landforms, followed by the detected anomalies, their archaeological context in Belterra (V2J8+J7 São José, Belterra – PA, Brazil), and finally a set of actionable insights for future prospection.

1. Major Terrain & Geomorphological Features  
• Broad, very gentle slope trending from northwest (higher elevations ~60 m asl) down to southeast (~55 m asl). No steep escarpments or river gullies are apparent.  
• A nearly planar interfluvial plateau, now under mechanized agriculture, has been leveled to within ±2 m.  
• Field boundaries and roads (NW–SE and NE–SW straight alignments) dominate the surface expression, reflecting modern land division rather than natural drainage.  
• LiDAR-DTM (cloth simulation) shows minimal natural microrelief—most subtle highs coincide with farm berms or levees.  

2. Archaeological Anomalies  
```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
    "description": "A set of low-amplitude, parallel linear ridges/trenches trending NW–SE across the central field. These lines are 3–5 m apart, each extending ca. 300 m and only 0.2–0.5 m high, best seen in NIR reflectance and faintly in the hillshade.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.11845,
        "lon": -54.98460,
        "radius": 200
    }
},
"anomaly_2": {
    "description": "A cluster of 15 small, nearly rectangular/oval mounded features (~5–8 m diameter, 0.3 m high), laid out in a rough 3×5 grid on the western part of the large field. Visible as discrete soil‐vegetation contrasts in the true-color and NIR imagery.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.11870,
        "lon": -54.98510,
        "radius": 100
    }
},
"anomaly_3": {
    "description": "An isolated, darker patch in the NIR band (low near-infrared reflectance) indicating atypical moisture/organic content. No modern waterbody is mapped here—could be a filled pond or pit feature.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.11915,
        "lon": -54.98445,
        "radius": 50
    }

3. Historical & Archaeological Context  
• Belterra lies on the eastern rim of the Amazon floodplain. Though best known for the 1930s Firestone rubber station (Belterra Experiment Station), the region falls within the western Amazon zone where pre-Columbian societies created earthworks (geoglyphs), raised fields, causeways, and terra preta soils.  
• Nearby geoglyph complexes (Santarém, Tapajós basin) date between 2500 BP and 500 BP and feature circular ditches, symmetrical plazas, and road networks—features that may survive under pasture or lightly tilled fields.  
• Raised agricultural fields (camellones) in seasonally flooded areas are well-documented elsewhere in Amazonia. Though the present fields appear dry, the subtle parallel ridges (anomaly 1) mirror camellón spacing found in Marajó and Mamirauá.  
• Terra preta deposits (charcoal-rich, high-phosphate soils) often coincide with low NIR reflectance anomalies (anomaly 3), due to higher organic matter and soil moisture retention.  
• Small mound clusters (anomaly 2) might represent domestic foundations, mortuary platforms, or ceremonial markers—compare to similar multi-mound compounds recorded in Upper Xingu and Upper Tapajós.

4. Correlations & Differences Across Data Sources  
• The faint NW–SE ridges are near-invisible in the raw elevation and LiDAR hillshade but become clear in NIR and true-color images as alternating vegetation vigor bands.  
• The mound cluster (anomaly 2) is marginally detectable in the elevation ras­ter (0.3 m highs), more distinct in the satellite scenes via differential soil moisture and plant stress.  
• The NIR dark patch (anomaly 3) has no corresponding topographic high/low, confirming a subsurface organic anomaly rather than a surface landform.

5. How These Findings Could Advance Current Theories  
• Confirmation of raised agricultural terraces here would expand the known distribution of Amazonian “camellones” into Pará’s terra firme zone—implying more widespread water-management ingenuity.  
• Discovery of small mound compounds away from forest islands suggests that pre-Columbian settlement was more dispersed and integrated into upland fields than previously thought.  
• Locating Terra Preta signatures under modern farms would reinforce the idea of deep continuity in Amazonian anthropogenic soils, despite extensive 20th-century land clearing.

6. Actionable Insights for Future Site Discovery  
[[[
- Conduct pedestrian transects along the NW–SE parallel ridges (anomaly 1) at 20 m intervals; look for subsoil charcoal, pottery fragments, or compacted plow-pan surfaces.
- Undertake 0.1 m–resolution micro-UAV LiDAR over the mound cluster (anomaly 2) to resolve their internal structure and test for buried floor surfaces or radial entry causeways.
- Deploy auger sampling on the NIR-dark patch (anomaly 3) to assay for elevated organic carbon and phosphate—hallmarks of terra preta.
- Extend NIR anomaly mapping into adjacent fields—parallel lineation suggests a broader grid of raised beds.
- Cross-reference local historical air photographs (1960s–80s) to track agricultural encroachment and pinpoint undisturbed forest edges that might reveal fresh earthwork exposures.

These combined steps should maximize the chance of verifying buried Amazonian earthworks and agricultural features at São José, thereby refining our understanding of pre-Columbian land-use in western Pará.
