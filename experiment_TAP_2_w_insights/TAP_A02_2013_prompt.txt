Analysis for TAP_A02_2013

Analyze these four images to identify and describe in detail the major terrain and geomorphological features. 
Search carefully for any archaeologically interesting anomalies. The images show:

The images are from the region of V2J8+J7 São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil, at (-3.1183872755, -54.984333535).

If anomalies are found:
  1. Draw on your knowledge of the region (V2J8+J7 São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil) and its history.
  2. Explain how the anomaly fits into the broader historical context.
  3. Discuss how it might challenge or advance current theories in the field. Give detailed background information on the geographic, historical, and archaeological context of the region.
  4. Note any differences or correlations between the different data sources.
  5. Provide actionable insights. These insights will be used as leverage for future discovery of sites, that is, it will be appended to future prompts to AI models.

Target your analysis to technology and archaeology enthusiasts interested in realistic, evidence-based advancements. Provide as much detail as possible.

Always include your actionable insights inside triple brackets:

[[[
actionable insights that can be used to discover new sites, such as:
- "Note the presence of a large, flat area at the coordinates (lat, lon) that could indicate an ancient settlement."
- "The presence of a linear feature in the LiDAR data suggests a possible ancient road or pathway."
- "The NIR band shows unusual vegetation patterns that may indicate buried structures or features."
]]]

If you detect an anomaly, output:
```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},
"anomaly_2": {
    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },

        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},
```

The images show:
1. A high-resolution elevation raster from OpenTopography
2. A digital terrain model extracted from LiDAR data using cloth simulation
3. A true-color (visual) Sentinel-2 satellite image
4. A near-infrared (NIR) Sentinel-2 band image


Previous insights:
- Conduct systematic pedestrian transect perpendicular to the NW–SE ridges at 20 m spacing to verify raised-bed construction, collect subsoil charcoal, and sample for anthropogenic soil horizons.
- Deploy a micro-UAV LiDAR survey (0.1 m resolution) over the en-echelon mound cluster (anomaly_2) to resolve internal layering, possible building floors, and entry causeways.
- Auger‐probe the NIR-dark patch (anomaly_3) to measure organic carbon, phosphates, and ceramic inclusions; target the east flank where the NIR signature is strongest.
- Extend NIR anomaly mapping 500 m up- and downstream along the natural levee to identify additional buried raised fields or mounded platforms.
- Compare these features with historical aerial photographs (1960s–80s) to assess agricultural disturbance and prioritize undisturbed forest margins for excavation.
