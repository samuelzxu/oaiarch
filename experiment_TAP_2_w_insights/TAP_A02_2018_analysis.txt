Below is a combined geomorphological and archaeological analysis of the three datasets over V2J8+J7 São José (–3.11839, –54.98434), Belterra, PA, Brazil.  

1. Terrain and Geomorphological Features  
- General slope: the DTM (LiDAR‐derived) shows a very gentle gradient sloping from the southeast down toward the northwest, dropping approximately 3–5 m over ~500 m.  
- Drainage pattern: incised narrow gullies (1–2 m deep) cut through the DTM, conforming to small ephemeral streams feeding into a larger channel off the north edge.  
- Field terraces and roads: the rectangular, bench‐like flat surfaces (10–20 m wide) visible in planform align with farm access tracks and small agricultural terraces carved into the natural slope.  
- Remnant forest‐islands: Patches of higher‐elevation, forested ground (dark, more vegetated in the visual) stand 1–2 m above surrounding cleared fields—likely natural levee remnants or slightly elevated “forest islands.”  
- Soil‐moisture drainage: subtle concave swales 5–10 m apart are visible in the NIR image as darker linear bands—likely historic water‐management furrows or natural depressions that retain moisture.  

2. Archaeologically Interesting Anomalies  
Despite heavy modern clearing, three features stand out as potential pre‐Columbian anthropic earthworks:  

```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
    "description": "Cluster of small, regular convex mounds (2–4 m diameter, 0.3–0.6 m high) in a roughly 3×4 grid alignment. Visible as subtle bumps in the DTM and as slightly brighter patches in the visual image.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.11885,
        "lon": -54.98620,
        "radius": 15
    }
},
"anomaly_2": {
    "description": "Linear, NW–SE oriented depression ~120 m long and 1.5 m deep, with parallel slight berms on either side. Corresponds to a faint lighter line in the visual and a moisture‐retaining stripe in NIR.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.11890,
        "lon": -54.98450,
        "radius": 60
    }
},
"anomaly_3": {
    "description": "Dark patch in NIR suggesting elevated soil moisture or organic‐rich fill. Roughly circular, ~25 m across, lies mid‐field with no modern feature overlay.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.11900,
        "lon": -54.98320,
        "radius": 12
    }
},
```

3. Historical & Archaeological Context  
- The Belterra region lies within the Tapajós–Xingu interfluve, where Late Holocene agrarian societies (c. 500 BC–AD 1500) built small ring‐ditch enclosures, causeways, and mound clusters for habitation and ceremonial purposes.  
- Ring‐ditch sites and causeways in nearby areas (e.g. near Lago Tapajós) are typically 40–80 m in diameter, often accompanied by raised platforms and parallel roads linking them.  
- The mound cluster (anomaly_1) fits the size and arrangement of household platforms seen in pre‐Columbian village sites; the linear feature (anomaly_2) resembles a short causeway or connecting trench; the NIR wet anomaly (anomaly_3) might mark a filled pond or central plaza.  
- If confirmed, these features could push back the mapped footprint of Geometric earthwork culture further south along these terraces and provide finer detail on settlement organization in a transitional savanna–forest environment.  

4. Comparison Across Data Sources  
- The DTM sharply delineates micro‐topography—ideal for finding small mounds and ditches.  
- The visual (true-color) image highlights recent cultivation patterns but also shows residual soil‐color contrasts over buried features (anomaly_2).  
- The NIR band is most sensitive to vegetation vigor and soil moisture; anomalies_2 and _3 appear most strongly here, suggesting fine‐textured fills or moisture‐retaining sediments.  

5. Actionable Insights  
[[[
- Systematically target the mound cluster at (–3.11885, –54.98620) with a NW–SE oriented convolution filter on the DTM to flag additional 2–5 m convexities.
- Conduct a micro-UAV LiDAR flight over anomaly_2 (–3.11890, –54.98450) at sub-10 cm resolution to map ditch cross-sections and confirm anthropic berms.
- Acquire multi-date NIR imagery for anomaly_3 (–3.11900, –54.98320) to perform time-series differencing—variations in moisture and vegetation may verify a filled pond or plaza.
- Extend DTM transects 200 m upstream and downstream along the gully network to search for aligned mound clusters or additional causeway segments.
- Overlay forthcoming high-resolution drone orthophotos onto existing ring-ditch site maps to test for spatial continuity with the newly detected linear anomaly.

This integrated approach—using micro-topography, spectral analysis, and targeted survey—will maximize the chance of validating and contextualizing these potential pre-Columbian earthworks.
