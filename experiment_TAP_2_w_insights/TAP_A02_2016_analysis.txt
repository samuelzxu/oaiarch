Below is a summary of the major terrain and geomorphological features, an archaeological‐anomaly catalog, and context-specific discussion. All locations are approximate and given in WGS84 decimal degrees.

1. Regional Terrain and Geomorphology  
   • The study area lies on a low‐relief, gently undulating plateau (~60–80 m a.s.l.) of late‐Quaternary alluvial‐lacustrine sediments derived from the Tapajós River system.  
   • Subtle ridge–furrow topography (3–5 m relief) trends NW–SE across the central field. These elongate berms, spaced ~15–25 m apart, are superimposed on a very gentle slope (1–2°) toward a minor palaeochannel to the northeast.  
   • A cluster of low circular mounds (1–2 m high, 10–20 m diameter) occupies the western third of the site, set on slightly raised ground where drainage is optimal.  
   • Natural scarps and shallow colluvial fans flank the plateau edges; these merge into incised seasonal channels (2–3 m deep), which likely guided past water management efforts.  

2. Detected Archaeological Anomalies  
```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
    "description": "Cluster of six regular, circular mounds (1–2 m high, 10–20 m diameter) aligned along a subtle NNW–SSE ridge on slightly elevated ground. Likely anthropogenic habitation or refuse mounds associated with terra preta soils.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.1187,
        "lon": -54.9849,
        "radius": 30
    }
},
"anomaly_2": {
    "description": "Series of parallel, rectilinear ridge–furrow features (3–5 m wide; 0.5–1 m high) trending NW–SE across the central plateau. Appear as linear berms in DTM and faint brightness contrasts in visual imagery—suggestive of raised agricultural fields or causeways.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.1183,
        "lon": -54.9843,
        "radius": 100
    }
},
"anomaly_3": {
    "description": "Dark depression (~15 m diameter, 0.5–1 m deep) that shows low reflectance in NIR—indicative of retained moisture and possible sub‐surface pit or pond used in past water control systems.",
    "location": {
        "lat": -3.1190,
        "lon": -54.9838,
        "radius": 15

3. Historical and Archaeological Context  
   • Belterra (Tapajós region) saw intensive pre‐Columbian landscape engineering—raised fields (camellones), causeways, ponds, and habitation mounds—dating from AD 500–1600. Early surveys by Meggers & Evans recognized anthropogenic “black earth” (terra preta) and scattered earthworks.  
   • The newly identified mounds align with known Amazonian village‐mound clusters. The parallel berms mirror raised agricultural platforms documented at nearby sites (e.g., Santarém Phase complexes), suggesting sophisticated flood‐adaptation.  
   • The NIR‐dark pit corresponds to small water‐harvesting features documented ethnographically and in LiDAR surveys—these helped regulate soil moisture during dry periods and may have doubled as fish‐ponds.  

   These anomalies reinforce models of high‐density, managed landscapes in the southern Amazon. They challenge the assumption of sparse pre‐Columbian populations here, instead supporting a network of interlinked settlements with elaborate hydraulic systems.  

4. Cross‐Data Correlation  
   • Elevation raster and DTM: Precisely resolve ridge heights (0.5–2 m) and moat‐like depressions; DTM is superior for subtle microtopography.  
   • Visual (RGB) imagery: Highlights vegetation differences over mounds and ridges—lighter tones over raised fields, darker over low ground.  
   • NIR band: Amplifies moisture‐related contrasts—depressions appear darkest; well‐drained berms reflect strongly.  

5. Implications for Theory and Practice  
   • The co‐occurrence of mounds, raised fields, and ponds in a small area suggests a fully integrated settlement–agriculture system, comparable to “garden‐cities” of the Llanos de Mojos and Marajó.  
   • These data support hypotheses of riverine social complexity in the Amazon preceding European contact—lending weight to recent geoarchaeological models that posit large, centralized polities rather than small, shifting horticultural camps.

Actionable Insights:
- Conduct systematic auger‐probing on and between the circular mounds at (-3.1187, -54.9849) to sample terra preta for ceramics and charcoal.
- Deploy ground‐penetrating radar transects perpendicular to the NW–SE berms centered at (-3.1183, -54.9843) to map full extent of raised fields.
- Install moisture sensors or shallow coring in the NIR‐dark depression at (-3.1190, -54.9838) to characterize sediment stratigraphy and assess pond function.
- Use UAV‐LiDAR over a 1 km² grid around the anomalies to locate connecting causeways or subsidiary platforms upslope and downslope.
- Compare high‐resolution historical aerial photography (1965–1980) to current LiDAR to prioritize areas with minimal modern disturbance for excavation.
