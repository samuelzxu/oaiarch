Analysis for TAP_A04_2018

Analyze these four images to identify and describe in detail the major terrain and geomorphological features. 
Search carefully for any archaeologically interesting anomalies. The images show:

The images are from the region of X2MP+3W São Benedito, Belterra - PA, Brazil, at (-3.017363876, -54.962676114999994).

If anomalies are found:
  1. Draw on your knowledge of the region (X2MP+3W São Benedito, Belterra - PA, Brazil) and its history.
  2. Explain how the anomaly fits into the broader historical context.
  3. Discuss how it might challenge or advance current theories in the field. Give detailed background information on the geographic, historical, and archaeological context of the region.
  4. Note any differences or correlations between the different data sources.
  5. Provide actionable insights. These insights will be used as leverage for future discovery of sites, that is, it will be appended to future prompts to AI models.

Target your analysis to technology and archaeology enthusiasts interested in realistic, evidence-based advancements. Provide as much detail as possible.

Always include your actionable insights inside triple brackets:

[[[
actionable insights that can be used to discover new sites, such as:
- "Note the presence of a large, flat area at the coordinates (lat, lon) that could indicate an ancient settlement."
- "The presence of a linear feature in the LiDAR data suggests a possible ancient road or pathway."
- "The NIR band shows unusual vegetation patterns that may indicate buried structures or features."

If you detect an anomaly, output:
```anomalies

    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},

The images show:
1. A high-resolution elevation raster from OpenTopography
2. A digital terrain model extracted from LiDAR data using cloth simulation
3. A true-color (visual) Sentinel-2 satellite image
4. A near-infrared (NIR) Sentinel-2 band image

actionable insights that can be used to discover new sites, such as:
- Note the large, straight micro-scarp at (–3.13395, –54.95380) for targeted coring or trenching to test for causeway fill.
- The triple mound cluster at (–3.13290, –54.95450) should be surveyed with UAV photogrammetry and auger probing for terra preta signatures.
- Sample the intermediate NIR reflectance spots near (–3.13350, –54.95500) with GPR to map subsurface ditches or pits.
- Conduct systematic field-walking along the 25–27 m a.s.l. levee crests just west of the main road at (–3.135, –54.9525) for ceramic scatters.
- Compare modern field boundary azimuths vs. LiDAR ridge orientations to isolate other misaligned linear features that may indicate buried causeways.
