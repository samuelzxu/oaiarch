Analysis for TAP_A03_2016

Analyze these four images to identify and describe in detail the major terrain and geomorphological features. 
Search carefully for any archaeologically interesting anomalies. The images show:

The images are from the region of V28W+FW São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil, at (-3.133864053, -54.95272016).

If anomalies are found:
  1. Draw on your knowledge of the region (V28W+FW São José, Belterra - PA, Brazil) and its history.
  2. Explain how the anomaly fits into the broader historical context.
  3. Discuss how it might challenge or advance current theories in the field. Give detailed background information on the geographic, historical, and archaeological context of the region.
  4. Note any differences or correlations between the different data sources.
  5. Provide actionable insights. These insights will be used as leverage for future discovery of sites, that is, it will be appended to future prompts to AI models.

Target your analysis to technology and archaeology enthusiasts interested in realistic, evidence-based advancements. Provide as much detail as possible.

Always include your actionable insights inside triple brackets:

[[[
actionable insights that can be used to discover new sites, such as:
- "Note the presence of a large, flat area at the coordinates (lat, lon) that could indicate an ancient settlement."
- "The presence of a linear feature in the LiDAR data suggests a possible ancient road or pathway."
- "The NIR band shows unusual vegetation patterns that may indicate buried structures or features."

If you detect an anomaly, output:
```anomalies

    "description": "A detailed description of the anomaly",
    "location": {
        "lat": lat, 
        "lon": lon, 
        "radius": r # radius in meters
        },  
},

The images show:
1. A digital terrain model extracted from LiDAR data using cloth simulation
2. A true-color (visual) Sentinel-2 satellite image
3. A near-infrared (NIR) Sentinel-2 band image


Previous insights:
- Target anomaly_1 (–3.1335, –54.9529): Conduct a GPR survey along the 150 m axis to map ditch fill stratigraphy; follow with shallow auger cores every 25 m to assess charcoal and terra preta content.
- At anomaly_2 (–3.1360, –54.9501): Deploy a micro‐UAV with high‐resolution multispectral + LiDAR (5 cm DEM) to resolve the concentric moat; extract a 1 m core through the mound crest to test for habitation debris (ceramics, charcoal).
- Systematically extend UAV‐LiDAR mapping over adjacent terrace remnants up to 500 m north and south to trace linear embankments into potential causeway networks.
- Employ NIR differencing on seasonal images to detect other moisture‐retaining linear anomalies hidden under canopy regrowth.
- Compare these features against 1970s aerial photography (rubber‐era archives) to identify sectors with minimal modern disturbance for small‐block test excavations.
