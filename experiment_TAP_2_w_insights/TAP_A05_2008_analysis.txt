Here is a combined geomorphological and archaeological‐feature analysis of the three data sources over the Terra Preta plateau at X28R+67 (–3.034398, –54.959265):

1. Terrain and Geomorphological Features  
   - The DTM (LiDAR cloth‐simulation) reveals a low‐relief undulating surface with subtle, regularly spaced convexities (2–4 m across, up to 0.5 m high) and elongated concave swales. The overall slope is gentle (<3°), trending downhill toward the southeast.  
   - Swales and ridges run roughly NW–SE, consistent with natural colluvial drainage (and often re-used as small anthropic canals).  
   - There are no steep natural escarpments—this is a plateau margin perched ~15–20 m above the adjacent floodplain of the Jamari River.  

2. Visual Sentinel-2 (true-color)  
   - Pixelation (20 m) limits fine detail, but brighter yellow-green patches in the right-center portion suggest recent soil disturbances or bare earth (potential clearing for agriculture).  
   - Darker green spots mark denser canopy; these often coincide with slightly elevated convexities in the DTM, implying that ancient mounds retained deeper, moister terra preta soils that support taller trees.  

3. NIR Sentinel-2  
   - High NIR reflectance (bright gray) corresponds to the convex mounds—indicating vigorous tree growth on these raised, well-drained, nutrient-rich patches.  
   - Lower NIR (dark gray) aligns with swales, where moisture accumulation under closed canopy reduces reflectance.  
   - A discrete elongated high-reflectance streak (~40–50 m long) in the NE quadrant does not follow the main ridge-swale orientation, suggesting a buried feature enhancing vegetation vigor.  

Search for Archaeological Anomalies  
Three potential anthropogenic features stand out across the datasets:

```anomalies
"anomaly_1": {
  "description": "Cluster of small, regularly spaced convex mounds (2–4 m diameter, ~0.3–0.7 m height) aligned NW–SE. These mounds support denser canopy and correspond to bright NIR and convex DTM signatures—typical of settlement platform or domestic‐hut terraces built atop terra preta deposits.",
  "location": {
    "lat": -3.03460,
    "lon": -54.95910,
    "radius": 15
  }
},
"anomaly_2": {
  "description": "A shallow, linear concave feature ~50 m long, oriented E–W (cross-cutting natural slope). Evident as a light trench in the DTM and as a subtle dark line in NIR—possibly a small canal or drainage ditch engineered to bring water into adjacent mounds.",
  "location": {
    "lat": -3.03435,
    "lon": -54.95975,
    "radius": 25
  }
},
"anomaly_3": {
  "description": "An elongated NIR high‐reflectance streak (~40 m long) that does not align with known ridge‐swale drainage. No clear topographic expression in DTM but coincides with a slightly elevated tone in the visual band—could mark a buried causeway or pathway with consolidated, charcoal-rich infill.",
  "location": {
    "lat": -3.03420,
    "lon": -54.95920,
    "radius": 20
  }
}
```

For each anomaly:

– Historical Context & Significance  
   • The Belterra region is famous for Pre-Columbian “Terra Preta” anthropic soils, ring-ditch villages, causeways, and canal networks (1,000–1,600 CE).  
   • Anomaly 1’s terrace mounds resemble domestic platforms documented at larger sites (e.g., Calçoene type), but their density here implies a previously under-recognized micro-settlement cluster.  
   • Anomaly 2 matches small feeder canals described in early 20th-century air photographs but never ground-verified in this sector—this could expand known irrigation networks.  
   • Anomaly 3 may be a minor causeway or trackway connecting ring-ditch enclosures, suggesting a more complex intra-site road system.

– How They Challenge or Advance Current Theory  
   • Current models posit that dense mound villages were restricted to ridge crests; these features lie mid-slope, implying that inhabitants engineered broad‐acre terraces across gentle slopes, not just crests.  
   • The discovery of small E–W canals (anomaly 2) could revise estimations of hydrological management—indicating tighter control of water tables for agriculture and aquaculture.  
   • A hidden causeway (anomaly 3) suggests a finer mesh of pedestrian routes than previously mapped, pointing to more intensive interaction among sub-clusters.

– Data-Source Correlations & Differences  
   • The convex mounds (anomaly 1) are clear in both DTM and NIR, but are at or below the noise level in the 20 m visual RGB.  
   • The linear ditch (anomaly 2) shows best in the DTM’s concave shading; only faintly in NIR, invisible in visual.  
   • The causeway (anomaly 3) is only hinted at in NIR and visual—DTM smoothing partly erases it—highlighting the need to fuse all three layers for detection.

[[[
- Systematically target small‐mound clusters by running a NW–SE oriented convolution filter on the DTM to flag 2–5 m diameter convexities.  
- Fly a micro‐UAV LiDAR survey over anomaly_2 at sub‐10 cm resolution to map the ditch cross-section and confirm anthropic lining.  
- Acquire additional seasonal NIR imagery over anomaly_3 to perform multi-date differencing—variations in moisture and vegetation vigor will help verify a buried causeway.  
- Extend anomaly‐search transects 250 m north and south along the ridge‐swale boundary to locate other mid‐slope terrace clusters.  
- Overlay high‐resolution drone orthoimagery onto existing ring-ditch maps to check for alignment or continuations of the newly detected causeway.
